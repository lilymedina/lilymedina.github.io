Citizen Attitudes Toward Traditional and State Authorities: Substitutes or Complements?
======

_With Peter van der Windt, Macartan Humphreys, Jeffrey Timmons, and Marteen Voors._

Do citizens view state and traditional authorities as substitutes or complements? Past work has been divided on this question. Some scholars point to competition between attitudes toward these entities, suggesting substitution, whereas others highlight positive correlations, suggesting complementarity. Addressing this question, however, is difficult, as it requires assessing the effects of exogenous changes in the latent valuation of one authority on an individual’s support for another. We show that this quantity—a type of elasticity—cannot be inferred from correlations between support for the two forms of authority. We employ a structural model to estimate this elasticity of substitution using data from 816 villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo and plausibly exogenous rainfall and conflict shocks. Despite prima facie evidence for substitution logics, our model’s outcomes are consistent with complementarity; positive changes in citizen valuation of the chief appear to translate into positive changes in support for the government.

Making, Updating, and Querying Causal Models with `CausalQueries`
======

_with Till Tietz, Georgiy Syunyaev, and Macartan Humphreys_

The [R]{.proglang} package `CausalQueries`  can be used to make, update, and query causal models defined on binary nodes. Users provide a causal statement of the form `X -> M <- Y; M <-> Y` which is interpreted as a structural causal model over a collection of binary nodes.  Then `CausalQueries` allows users to (1) identify the set of principal strata---causal types---required to characterize all possible causal relations between nodes that are consistent with the causal statement (2) determine a set of parameters needed to characterize distributions over these causal types (3) update beliefs over distributions of causal types, using a `stan` model plus data, and (4) pose a wide range of causal queries of the model, using either the prior distribution, the posterior distribution, or a user-specified candidate vector of parameters.

With or Without the State: The Effects of State-Sanctioned Militias on Civilian Victimization (Dissertation Chapter)
======
This chapter examines how the legalization of militias shapes levels of violence against civilians during civil conflict. Drawing on original data from Colombia’s Convivir program—a state initiative that authorized civilian groups to support counterinsurgency efforts—I investigate whether legal recognition affects how militias behave and how civilians experience violence. I argue that legalization alters wartime dynamics through three implicit mechanisms: it makes militias more legible to the state, enables greater regulation of their actions, and signals legitimacy to civilians, especially local elites. These mechanisms generate testable expectations about the relationship between legalization and levels of civilian victimization, elite participation, and insurgent violence. Using municipal-level data on violence and militia presence, I provide  estimates of the effects of legalization using the Sun and Abraham (2021) estimator. Findings suggest that legalization may reduce guerrilla violence.
