I’m a Ph.D Student in political science at U.C. Berkeley with an M.S. in Statistics from the Humboldt University.  My work includes evaluating community-driven development initiatives and their effect on citizen attitudes toward authority as well as R-packages for experimental designs. 

My substantive research interests include political violence, criminal governance and citizens’ attitudes towards state and non-state actors. Methodologically, I'm interested in Bayesian statistics and causal inference.
