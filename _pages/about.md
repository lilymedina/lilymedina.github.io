I’m a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Institutions and Political Inequalities unit at WZB with an M.S. in Statistics from Humboldt University. Currently, my main research interest is examining the possible (causal) links between mental health and economic outcomes. My work includes evaluating community-driven development initiatives and their effect on citizen attitudes toward authority as well as R-packages for experimental designs.
