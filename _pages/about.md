I’m a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Institutions and Political Inequalities unit at WZB with an M.S. in Statistics from Humboldt University. Currently. My work includes evaluating community-driven development initiatives and their effect on citizen attitudes toward authority as well as R-packages for experimental designs.
