Iâ€™m a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Institutions and Political Inequalities unit at WZB with an M.S. in Statistics from the Humboldt University.  My work includes evaluating community-driven development initiatives and their effect on citizen attitudes toward authority as well as R-packages for experimental designs. 

My main substantive interest right now is understanding the possible (causal) links between the mental health of refugees and their integration into their host society. Methodologically, I'm interested in Bayesian statistics and causal inference.
