I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science (Comparative Politics) at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Research Associate at the  [Center of the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/).  Two interconnected themes run through my work: how civilians experience violence, and how they navigate loyalties between state and non-state actors in their search for protection.

My dissertation focuses on an understudied phenomenon in the civil wars literature: legal militias. I ask why civilians form legal militias during civil wars and how legalization shapes the interaction between civilians and armed groups. In particular, I examine how legal militias affect patterns of civilian collaboration and violence against civilians.

Methodologically, I triangulate quantitative and qualitative evidence. On the quantitative side, I have assembled an original municipality–year panel dataset of the legal militias created in Colombia and linked it with existing data on violence and political conditions. I draw on recent advances in panel data methods to make causal inferences about the effects of legalization. On the qualitative side, I rely on extensive fieldwork. Because much of my work is subnational, I conducted interviews not only with national-level decisionmakers such as ministers and peace commissioners, but also with local elites such as large landowners, and former militia members

My work also extends beyond armed groups. In two ongoing collaborations, I examine the effects of feminist protest on violence against women, and I participate in a project that studies youth political participation in smaller cities. This project investigates how young people’s political engagement is shaped by violence and insecurity, an area that has received little attention.


Alongside this substantive research, I contribute to political methodology through the development of the [CausalQueries](https://github.com/macartan/CausalQueries) R package. This software enables researchers to specify and update causal models with Bayesian inference in order to answer counterfactual questions within a potential outcomes framework. The package is particularly useful in contexts where causal identification through standard research designs is difficult or impossible. Our paper, *Making, Updating, and Querying Causal Models with CausalQueries* (with Till Tietz, Georgiy Syunyaev, and Macartan Humphreys), was recently conditionally accepted for publication in the *Journal of Statistical Software*.
