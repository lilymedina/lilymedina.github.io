Iâ€™m an incoming Ph.D Student in Political Science at UC Berkeley with an M.S. in Statistics from the Humboldt University.  My work includes evaluating community-driven development initiatives and their effect on citizen attitudes toward authority as well as R-packages for experimental designs. 

My main substantive interest right now is understanding why people engage in violent behavior and the consequences of violence on political, economic and psychological outcomes. Methodologically, I'm interested in Bayesian statistics and causal inference.
