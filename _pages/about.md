I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Research Associate at the  [Center of the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/) My research examines when and why civilians form counterinsurgent militias in civil war contexts, and what happens when the state chooses to legally recognize some of these groups. I draw on a mix of archival research, interviews, and quantitative evidence from Colombia.

Two interconnected themes run through my work: how civilians experience violence, and how they navigate loyalties between state and non-state actors in their search for protection.

Another interest of mine is developing and contributing to open-source software. I’ve worked on R packages for [experimental designs](https://declaredesign.org/library/) and [Bayesian methods for causal inference](https://github.com/macartan/CausalQueries).
